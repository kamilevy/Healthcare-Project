Project Proposal

Title: Examining Access to Healthcare in Zipcodes Across Missouri and Kansas

Team Members: Andrew Mullenger, Jarrett Campbell, Kami Whitehurst-Levy

Project Description: Our client, Ascension Health, is looking to expand its footprint across Missouri and Kansas with the aim of improving access to healthcare in underserved communities. Our goal is to examine current levels of access for zipcodes in Missouri and Kansas and determine if there is any correlation between zip code demographics/types of zip codes (rural, suburban, etc.) and level of healthcare access. This will help Ascension more efficiently target areas for expansion so they can have a serious impact on healthcare access. 

Research Questions:

    * 1. Are low-income areas likely to have fewer doctor’s offices and hospitals per capita than high-income areas?

    * 2. Are rural locations likely to have fewer doctor’s offices and hospitals per capita than suburban and urban areas?

    * 3. Are areas with higher minority populations likely to have fewer doctor's offices and hospitals per capita than areas with lower minority populations?

    * 4. Are areas with lower average resident ages more likely to have fewer doctor's offices and hospitals per capita than areas with higher average resident ages?

    5. Does the quality in available healthcare vary based on demographic stats?

Hypotheses:

    1. All else equal, low-income areas will have a lower number of doctors and hospitals per capita than higher-income areas.


    2. All else equal, rural locations will have fewer doctor’s office and hospitals per capita than suburban and urban areas.

    3. All else equal, areas with higher minority populations will have fewer doctors offices and hospitals per capita than areas with lower minority populations. 

    4. All else equal, areas with lower average resident ages will have fewer doctor's offices and hospitals per capita than areas with higher average resident ages

Data Sets: Google Maps to look at the areas that facilities in Misssouri and Kansas.  Census information to look for age, zips codes and demographics. Kaggle as another research database.

Data Challenges: 

    Census data quality could be an issue. Certain zip codes might not have certain data points if the info wasn't able to be collected.

    Querying the Google Maps API data for types of healthcare facilities could be challenging depending on the available filters. Our scope may change depending on the quality of data we're able to pull. 

Initial Task Breakdown:

    Andrew: Data collection and cleanup - gathering census data and pulling info from Google Maps API, cleaning it up and preparing it for analysis. Developing slides relevant to this work section. Contributing to developing conclusions and recommendations.

    Kami: Data analysis and regression modeling - taking clean data and calculating relevant metrics, developing regressions that will help  answer key research questions. Developing slides relevant to this work section. Contributing to developing conclusions and recommendations.

    Jarrett: Data visualization - synthesizing calculated metrics into relevant, clear visualizations that support conclusions and recommendations. Developing slides relevant to this work section. Contributing to developing conclusions and recommendations.
